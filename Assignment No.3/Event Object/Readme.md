### Event Object
An event listener is an object that "listens" for events from a specific GUI component (which is also an object.) An event in Java is represented as an object. When the user generates an event, the Java system creates an event object. The event object is then sent to the listener that has been registered for the GUI component.

When an event is generated by the GUI component, a method in the listener object is invoked to respond to the event. In order to respond to events, your program must have done two things:
- It must create an event listener object for the type of event.
- It must register the listener object with the GUI component that generates the event (or with a component that contains it.)
