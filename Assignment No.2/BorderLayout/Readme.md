### Border Layout
The BorderLayout is used to arrange the components in five regions: north, south, east, west and center. Each region (area) may contain one component only. It is the default layout of frame or window. The BorderLayout provides five constants for each region:
1. public static final int NORTH
1. public static final int SOUTH
1. public static final int EAST
1. public static final int WEST
1. public static final int CENTER

### Constructors of BorderLayout class:
- BorderLayout(): creates a border layout but with no gaps between the components.
- JBorderLayout(int hgap, int vgap): creates a border layout with the given horizontal and vertical gaps between the components.
